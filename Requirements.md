This structure ensures a clear separation of concerns, letting the front-end focus on user experience and the back-end handle data, AI, and system logic.

## 15. Payment & Subscription Management

To allow users to pay, manage subscriptions, and receive invoices, we can integrate **Stripe** into the Next.js application. This setup can handle recurring payments, different subscription tiers (e.g., Free, Pro, Enterprise), and automated invoicing.

### 15.1 Stripe Integration Approach
- **Stripe Dashboard**: Create products, pricing plans, and subscription tiers.
- **Server-Side Implementation**: Leverage Next.js API routes or a dedicated Node.js server to handle:
  - **Customer Creation**: Link TheChatBot user accounts to Stripe customer records.
  - **Subscription Management**: Create, update, or cancel subscriptions.
  - **Webhook Handling**: Process Stripe events (e.g., payment succeeded, subscription renewed, invoice paid).
- **Client-Side Checkout**:
  - Use **Stripe.js** or **Stripe Checkout** to collect payment details.
  - Optionally embed a "customer portal" so users can view payment history, update payment methods, or upgrade/downgrade their plan.

### 15.2 Managing Subscription State
- **Plan Enforcement**:
  - Restrict feature access (e.g., number of chatbots, usage caps) based on the user’s current subscription tier.
  - Update the user’s tier in the database as soon as a Stripe webhook confirms subscription changes.
- **Billing History & Invoices**:
  - Stripe automatically generates invoices for subscription payments.
  - Surfaces these invoices in a "Billing" or "Subscription" section of the user’s account page.

### 15.3 Automating Emails & Notifications
- **Stripe’s Email Receipts**:
  - Stripe can email customers upon successful payments and subscription events.
- **Webhook-Triggered Notifications**:
  - If a payment fails or a subscription is about to expire, your Next.js backend can send automated emails or in-app alerts to prompt user action.

### 15.4 Implementation Steps
1. **Configure Stripe**:
   - Obtain API keys and set up products and pricing.
   - Enable relevant webhooks.
2. **Next.js API Routes**:
   - `/api/stripe/create-checkout-session`: Creates a Stripe Checkout session for paid plans.
   - `/api/stripe/webhooks`: Receives and processes webhook events.
3. **Client-Side Flow**:
   - A "Manage Subscription" or "Upgrade" button triggers the creation of a new Checkout session or opens the Stripe customer portal.
   - On success, the user is redirected back to your site with updated subscription data.
4. **Data Persistence**:
   - Store relevant subscription info (plan tier, status, billing cycle) in your database for quick lookups.

### 15.5 Future Enhancements
- **Metered Billing**:
  - If TheChatBot charges based on usage (e.g., number of messages), integrate Stripe’s metered billing.
- **Discounts & Coupons**:
  - Let business owners offer coupons for promotional campaigns.
- **Proration & Tiered Pricing**:
  - Adjust plan cost if users upgrade mid-cycle or handle tiered usage.
